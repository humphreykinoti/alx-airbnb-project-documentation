## ðŸ“˜ User Stories

This section translates the functional interactions from the use case diagram into user stories that describe how different users will interact with the Airbnb Clone backend.

### ðŸ”‘ Core User Stories

1. **User Registration**
   *As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can use the platform as a guest or host.*

2. **User Login**
   *As a registered user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my profile and perform actions.*

3. **Add Property Listing**
   *As a host, I want to create a new property listing so that guests can find and book it.*

4. **Book a Property**
   *As a guest, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can plan my stay.*

5. **Make a Payment**
   *As a guest, I want to pay securely for my booking so that it can be confirmed.*

These stories form the foundation of the system's functionality and will guide development and testing.
